This is my equivariant graph neural network library. I have one goal only:
- to make the implementation so simple that I can come back to it in a few months and understand how it works

Why am I doing this?

Equivariant Graph Neural Network libraries are pretty complex and not well-explained. I'm doing this so I can learn the math and the minute details.
